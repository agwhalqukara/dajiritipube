Smart’s ex lover <strong>William “Billy” Flynn</strong> and his friend <strong>Patrick Randall</strong> have been granted parole within one month of each other following the murder of her husband <strong>Gregory Smart</strong>.</p><p>A brutal story still making headlines, Pamela plotted the Derry, New Hampshire murder of her 24-year-old husband Gregory in 1990. Flynn, 16 years old at the time, shot Gregory in the head as Randall held a knife to his throat.</p><p><a href=#>Last month,</a> Flynn was granted parole on his first attempt, which also happened to be on his 41st birthday. This week, Randall <a href=#>also got his freedom.</a></p><p>“Nothing I can say can make it better,” Randall told Gregory’s relatives on Thursday, April 9. He also noted that losing his mother and grandfather while in prison made him realize what it’s like to say goodbye to a loved one. Gregory’s brother Dean Smart, however, refused to see the comparison.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“If you had actually lost your mother, imagine it being in the news every day for 25 years,” he said, via The Associated Press. Gregory’s aunt, Debbie Smart, added: “I am deathly afraid of this man. He murdered my nephew.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Flynn and Randall may have been released, but Pamela, now 47, will never get that chance. The former high school media coordinator, whose murder plot inspired the 1995 <a href=#><strong>Nicole Kidman</strong></a> crime drama To Die For, is serving life without parole at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women in Westchester County, New York.</p><p>The new developments, oddly enough, come at the same time as another highly publicized court scandal. Mary Kay Letourneau, who famously had an affair and later married her former student Vili Fualaau, recently sat down for an <a href=#>interview with Barbara Walters,</a> which will air on Friday, April 10. The couple, who share two teen daughters, will be celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary on May 20.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKeapZWhrm6%2FzJqpratdmsVuuM6vnKtlkZiwsLnPpaCcnV2cv6K6056bZqiRp7ytsYyana2domJ%2BeoWPZqSuqpSav25%2Bj2pscmw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./interesting-facts-about-harriet-tubman-2024-edition.html><span>←</span><span>Interesting Facts About Harriet Tubman 2024 Edition</span></a>
