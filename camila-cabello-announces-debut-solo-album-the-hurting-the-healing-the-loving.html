The Healing. The Loving.</p><p>In a personal note, the former Fifth Harmony songstress explains that “The Hurting. The Healing. The Loving. is the story of my journey from darkness into light, from a time when I was lost to a time when I found myself again.”</p><p>Talking about the story behind the album, she explains that it “starts with the second song that you’ll hear called ‘I Have Questions,’&nbsp;which I started writing in a hotel bathroom on tour a little over a year ago. I was completely broken during that time, I was in the kind of pain that’s uncomfortable to talk about, and it was the kind of chapter you never want to read out loud. I couldn’t write another song for 6 months because writing meant&nbsp;I had to feel everything, and I wasn’t ready to do that yet.”</p><p>One day, she realised that she couldn’t run away from it anymore, and after going back to lyrics she wrote the previous year, ‘I Have Questions’ was born. It sparked Camila to pour her feelings into writing “a sad song everyday, everything I wanted to say, every lyric on my phone, I said everything until I got tired of writing about it. Until I was sick of the sad songs!!!!!”</p><p>In turn, working on the album was like therapy for her, which enabled her to become happier. “As I got happier and happier, I realized the songs were getting happier and happier. And I realized I wasn’t making music just to make an album anymore, I was making this music to heal. It wasn’t until I had made enough songs to listen back to and realized&nbsp;I could hear myself coming back through these songs.”</p><p>“I didn’t write it with the intention of delivering a message, but I realized the message was in the hurting, the healing, and the loving,”&nbsp;Camila continued.&nbsp;“I might have thought the hurting was my enemy before, but she became the best listener… I might have thought I was too impatient for the healing, and it did feel like sometimes she was taking forever, but I realized it made me appreciate her so much more when she arrived. and the loving, I wouldn’t have known how beautiful she was if I couldn’t miss her all that time.”</p><p>Rounding off her emotional post, Camila left a final message.</p><p>“To the hurting, thank you for teaching me that even if at night you take me into the deepest depths of the ocean, I will still wake in the morning.<br>To the healing, thank you for the tears. When they finally came, they tasted like God.<br>To the loving, you are even more beautiful than&nbsp;I remember.”</p><p lang=und dir=ltr>05.19.17 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/oFbpneJSlV</a></p><p>— camila (@Camila_Cabello) <a href=#>May 15, 2017</a></p><p>Fans haven’t got long to wait for the first taste of Camila’s solo material either.
