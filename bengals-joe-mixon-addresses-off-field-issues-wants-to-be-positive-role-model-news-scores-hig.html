I'm going to try to do whatever I can to be what I am to the teammates and the fans and try to do whatever I can to be that positive role model in this here locker room because that's what matters."</p><p>Dehner noted there is still a civil case pending against the running back and cases outstanding against his sister and trainer regarding an incident near his home in which a minor was shot during a game of "Nerf Wars."</p><p>ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Ben Baby</a> noted Mixon was not a suspect in the criminal investigation for that incident.</p><p>"I felt what's understood don't need to be explained," Mixon said when asked if he ever explained the various situations to his teammates, per Dehner.</p><p>"Everybody on the team knew what it was. Everybody knew what it is. In terms of that, I'm just going to keep on doing what I can to keep on being that positive role model around here. I'm just going to keep on doing what I can to building the leader and camaraderie around the locker room."</p><p>Baby reported Sunday that Mixon said he would not be speaking with specific reporters from ESPN, <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, the <i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i> and Pro Football Network because of what he saw as disrespectful treatment.</p><p>His agent, Peter Schaffer, also responded to Baby:</p>Peter Schaffer <span class=acct>@peterjschaffer</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>You know exactly why we don't talk to you. You consistently look for the negative and always are putting the players down. &lt;br>&lt;br>We have given you ample chances to correct the situation and you refuse. You made your bed now sleep in it. Don't tweet to people that you don't know why.</p><p>As for the aggravated menacing case in which Mixon was found not guilty, police said he pointed a gun at a woman. Yet a municipal court judge said prosecutors did not prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt when issuing the ruling, per Baby.</p><p>The 2023 campaign will be his seventh with the team that selected him with a second-round pick in the 2017 NFL draft. He ran for 814 yards and seven touchdowns at 3.9 yards per carry last season, which was a dropoff from the 1,205 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns on the ground at 4.1 yards per carry he posted in 2021.</p><p>Cincinnati starts its 2023 season on Sept. 10 against the Cleveland Browns.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaGuFdIWMm5ynn5GhwG62zp5kpqGopLturcOdqZ6ro5rAbrvFn2SfoZWhsW610qysnqtdrK6vwNJmq6hlkpp6sbvSoquirpViv7C4xGakqJyVoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aliso-viejo-neighbors-recreate-pirates-of-the-caribbean-ride-for-halloween.html><span>←</span><span>Aliso Viejo neighbors recreate Pirates of the Caribbean ride for Halloween</span></a>
