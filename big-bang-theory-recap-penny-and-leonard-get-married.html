<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Big Bang Theory Recap: Penny and Leonard Get Married</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The Big Bang Theory kicked off Season 9 the only way it knew how — with a big bang! Last we saw, Penny (<strong>Kaley Cuoco</strong>) and Leonard (<strong>Johnny Galecki</strong>) were on their way to a Las Vegas altar to tie the knot. Well, at least that was the initial plan before Leonard confessed to drunkenly kissing another woman during that expedition of his a few years back.</p><p>So did this little reveal leave Penny with second thoughts about their nuptials? Read on to learn all about the episode’s most noteworthy moments!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong>Amy and Sheldon Officially Call It Quits</strong></p><p>Those who were hoping to see this dynamic duo reconcile right away were probably very disappointed with the night’s turn of events. After Sheldon (<strong>Jim Parsons</strong>) refused to give Amy (<strong>Mayim Bialik</strong>) the proper amount of time to think things over about their relationship, she decided to make the separation permanent by breaking up with him completely.</p><p>But given that Sheldon’s mother refused to take the engagement ring back right away, odds are this boy genius could still end up getting down on one knee in the future. Otherwise, no amount of “Soft Kitty” lullabies is ever going to make this breakup okay.</p><p><strong>Penny and Leonard Say “I Do”</strong></p><p>It may not have been the most romantic wedding in television history. In fact, it probably wouldn’t even make it into the top 20. But that doesn’t mean Penny and Leonard’s Las Vegas wedding ceremony wasn’t filled with love… even if their friends completely missed it being televised because they were too distracted by Amy and Sheldon’s bickering. But like Howard (Simon Helberg) said, they could always make up for it in the comments section.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Stuart Is Still Super Creepy</strong></p><p>In fact, in the middle of Amy’s breakup grief, Stuart (Kevin Sussman) actually attempted to hit on her. Let’s not make this a weekly occurrence, shall we?</p><p><strong>Happily Never After</strong></p><p>Though Penny had assured Leonard that she was over his brief cheating scandal, when the time came on their wedding night to “seal the deal,” she couldn’t stop picturing her new hubby with the other woman. Leonard tried to make her feel better and assured her of how guilty he felt. However, he only ended up making it worse after accidentally revealing that she’s one of his co-workers whom he sees on a daily basis.</p><p>Suffice to say, the honeymoon was cut way, way short. The not-so-happy couple returned home and went to their separate apartments, leaving viewers to wonder if this will end up being the shortest marriage in TV history. Let’s hope not!</p><p><strong>Bazinga Busters:</strong></p><p>“We’ve put this off long enough. Let’s do it.” -Penny about getting married</p><p>“Aww, that’s what you said to me the first time we slept together.” -Leonard</p><p>“Wow, hope I can catch the bouquet from here.” -Amy to Penny</p><p>“She was in love with her captor and managed to escape his dark and crazy dungeon.” -Howard about Amy and Sheldon’s breakup</p><p>“Those eggs you’re toting around have a sell-by date.” -Sheldon to Amy</p><p>“Finally there’s a Mrs. Hofstadter that isn’t disappointed in me.” -Leonard</p><p>“Well, the night is still young.” -Penny</p><p>You’re a man. The champagne of genders.” -Sheldon</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I can’t believe I’m spending my wedding night with you.” -Leonard</p><p>“Really? I never imagined it any other way.” -Sheldon</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: Did The Big Bang Theory premiere hit its mark?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOm6CgZZKWu6h506GcqKqpYr%2Bmr8CpZKmdnqPGbq3NnWSlnZ%2BjrrOwjKCcrWWdlr%2BztcSdZGtoYWp%2FcoU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./arrah-lynn-biography-wiki-net-worth-boyfriend-height-more.html><span>←</span><span>Arrah Lynn Biography, Wiki, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
