For three decades, her family wondered where she had gone — or if she was even alive.</p><p>Then, shockingly, 31 years after her disappearance, she was found 1,700 miles away in a nursing home in Puerto Rico.</p><p>In the years prior to her disappearance, Kopta had become increasingly zealous in her religious beliefs. She often went on nonsensical rants and claimed that the Virgin Mary had warned her of an impending nuclear armageddon.</p><p>Her husband, Bob Kopta, said she had lost her job and spent most of her time downtown, preaching to anyone who would listen. She would hang around outside of baseball games and concerts, telling people to go home as the world would end in three days’ time.</p><p>After developing dementia, she somehow made her way to Puerto Rico. There, in a nursing home, she began to reveal details about her past, and employees were able to identify her. It’s a sad story, but one that at last reached its conclusion.</p><h2>Three Florida Men Tortured And Waterboarded The Wrong Guy In An Airbnb</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-463093 alt="Florida Men Torture" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/florida-men-torture.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-463093 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Broward County Sheriff’s Office</span><span class=caption-body>Raymond Gomez, Jeffry Arista, and Jonathan Arista.</span></p><p>In October, three men — Raymond Gomez, Jeffry Arista, and Jonathan Arista — allegedly kidnapped a man outside his apartment. It was only later that they realized the man was not who they thought he was — and <a href=# rel=noopener>proceeded to torture him anyway</a>.</p><p>As it turned out, the man they’d kidnapped was a co-worker of their intended victim, so the men figured they could get some of the information they were looking for out of him anyway. They allegedly pointed a gun at his head, pressed the tip of a power drill against his skin, and waterboarded him in the Airbnb’s bathroom.</p><p>According to investigators, the three men then attempted to use their victim to lure out their target, who was at a club at the time. It was during this attempt that the victim was able to call the police and report a “bomb threat” at the club, prompting a quick response from authorities and the subsequent arrest of his alleged kidnappers.</p><h2>The Remains Of Daisy Mae Heath — Missing Since 1987 — Were Finally Identified</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-463094 alt="Daisy Mae Heath" width=900 height=643 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/daisy-mae-heath.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-463094 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Patricia Whitefoot</span><span class=caption-body>Daisy Mae Heath’s remains were found in a remote area on the Yakama Reservation in 2008 but remained unidentified until this year.</span></p><p>Twenty-nine-year-old Daisy Mae Heath vanished without a trace in 1987. According to the <a href=# rel=noopener>Yakima Herald-Republic</a>, Heath often traveled between White Swan on the Yakama Reservation and the Warm Springs Reservation in Oregon, where she would visit family and friends.</p><p>But then, two months passed, and no one had seen or heard from her. At the time, she had been living with her sister, Patricia Whitefoot, who described Heath as having been in a “very vulnerable state” around the time of her disappearance.</p><p>Then, in 2008, human remains were found in a remote spot on the Yakama Reservation. At the time, it was unclear who they had once belonged to — but in January 2023, DNA-testing facility Othram Laboratories finally identified the remains as Daisy Mae Heath’s.</p><p>It remains unclear how she died.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonykvsimnGamlazAbn6Pa2poag%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./under-the-table-money.html><span>←</span><span>Under-the-table money</span></a>
