"We will always remember Kerry fondly," the British TV personality wrote in his column. "He was a gentle man who will be missed greatly. He was still young and handsome at 60 years of age. He didn’t smoke or drink alcohol, preferring his favorite juices regimen."</p><p>Chicago-born Simon, who was given his rock n' roll nickname by Rolling Stone, solidified his celebrity chef status after winning a 2005 episode of Iron Chef. Also a successful restaurateur, he owned several restaurants in locations including Vegas, L.A., and Atlantic City, New Jersey.</p><p>In a 2010 interview with <a href=#>Haute Living</a>, Simon dished some details about his work ethic, explaining that he wanted every item on his menu to be amazing.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"For example, chicken wings (at CatHouse). I must have spent three months developing them. I know it sounds silly but I went through so many different processes over chicken wings and it just went on and on," he said. "At the end of it all, it is all about hard work. I study everything and look at everything that is going on. I read everything from newspapers to food magazines to cookbooks. That plays the biggest role in what I do."</p><p>Simon, who grew up wanting to be a rock star, kicked off his culinary career back when <strong>Donald Trump</strong>'s first wife, <strong>Ivana</strong>, tasked him with running the Plaza Hotel's Edwardian Room in the late '80s. Eventually, Simon moved on and up, working under world-renowned French chef <strong>Jean-Georges Vongerichten</strong>.</p><p>Reflecting back on his rise to the top, Simon told Haute Living in the same interview: "One thing if you look at my career through the years, I have taken a lot of gambles, some which were not so great, some that were very great. I [am a] very searching, spiritual person so there is something that happens through everything I have done, whether it has been the lowest part of my career or the highest part of my career, that has some sort of relativeness to that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKCrp55isKmxxWaqrZmiYrGmrdOhZKSdoqfGbr%2FIpqanZZSesrR5wK1kb2hdm7%2BwuYymqpplYmV%2Bdn2Qcg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-stone-bio-height-age.html><span>←</span><span>Emma Stone Bio, Height, Age</span></a>
