Nor will we, to a certain degree. I do not think any of us want to see the show go,’ Padalecki dished at the time.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Ackles added that: ‘I don’t think we’ll ever say goodbye to these characters. I mean, living with them for 15 years…is only the start… I think that it was Stallone that said – ‘to the greatest imaginary friend I have ever had’ talking about Rocky Balboa and I kind of feel the same way. These guys will live with us forever.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGealr%2BmsIypmJ2ZnJqwrLWMq5ypp6KpsqW42Gaqnqxdqbxuv9OaqWahnmKubr7Em6aorF2ks27DwKWinqpdqbK5rdJmqZqml5q%2Fbn%2BRbGxual8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zachary-shipman-family-parents-wife-and-kids.html><span>←</span><span>Zachary Shipman Family: Parents Wife And Kids</span></a>
