He’s still hurting over Megan but he’s determined to be happy and not mope around. It’s too early to say what will happen between him and this new girl [Tina] but she’s definitely his type. His friends are happy to see him dating again and getting back out there. He’s such a good guy with so much to offer.’</p><p><a href=#>Megan</a> and Brian got married back in 2010 and they have three kids together ages 3, 6 and 7!</p><p>A second insider also told the site that Brian was determined to have a lot of fun dating after the divorce all the while remaining respectful of his former wife.</p><p>‘He is taking things one day at a time as he respects Megan and the kids too much to rush into anything. He is taking on dates and also business meetings through his breakup with Megan and looking to have fun and not be super serious. He is just trying to get back in the swing of things and Tina is really cool. So if something happens that would be great, but if not he is not sweating it,’ they told the news outlet.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Tina is not his only date, as Brian was seen with <a href=#>model Courtney Stodden</a> as well, but he’s still keeping things casual, not trying to get into anything serious again so fast.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSp7aiuoyarKysmaN6qL7EnqVmq5Watq%2BzjK2gp5ldoby2tdKeZKKrXaeysbvRrZydpKlitaa4z6KloGWYnrpus8StZKiulad6rrHGmqVmnp%2BteqW11aipnJ1daX5zfphvZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./backpacker-killer-ivan-milat-murdered-twenty-more-victims-experts-claim.html><span>←</span><span>Backpacker killer Ivan Milat murdered TWENTY more victims, experts claim</span></a>
