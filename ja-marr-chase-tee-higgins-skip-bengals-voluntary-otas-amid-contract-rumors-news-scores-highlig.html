The Bengals used the <a href=# rel=noopener>franchise tag</a>, which will guarantee him $21.8 million, to keep him from becoming a free agent.</p><p>Given how quickly Cincinnati applied the tag—it was announced on Feb. 26, well ahead of the March 5 deadline to do so—it seemed to suggest the two sides weren't close to a long-term deal.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel=noopener>Kelsey Conway</a> of the <i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i>, one recent offer from the Bengals "never approached" $20 million per season, and it was so low that Higgins' representatives didn't bother to discuss guaranteed money with the club.</p><p>Higgins has requested a trade from the Bengals but also <a href=# rel=noopener>acknowledged</a> he anticipates playing for the team in 2024 before becoming a free agent next offseason.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Conway</a> reported on April 29 that Higgins was seeking a deal similar to the three-year, $70 million contract Michael Pittman Jr. signed with the Indianapolis Colts this offseason.</p><p>Chase's deal comes with less urgency because he has two years remaining on his rookie contract. This offseason is the first time he's eligible to sign a long-term extension.</p><p>One potential complicating factor for the Bengals is Chase has <a href=# rel=noopener>suggested</a> he wants to wait until after Justin Jefferson signs his next contract.</p><p>Schefter <a href=#>said</a> last week on <i>SportsCenter </i>that whenever Jefferson eventually signs a new deal with the Minnesota Vikings, it will make him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL.</p><p>San Francisco 49ers star Nick Bosa is currently the <a href=# rel=noopener>highest-paid</a> non-quarterback after signing a five-year, $170 million extension last September.</p><p>Considering this is only the voluntary portion of the offseason activities, the Bengals don't have to be overly concerned that neither player is participating.</p><p>The next big event on the offseason calendar for the Bengals is mandatory minicamp from June 11-13. If Chase decides to skip that, then there might be the possibility of a holdout by the time training camp starts in July.</p><p>Higgins' situation is a little more complicated because he hasn't signed the franchise tender. The Bengals could receive a trade offer between now and the start of the season that's too good to pass up.</p><p>In their first two seasons as teammates in 2021 and 2022, Chase and Higgins both surpassed the 1,000-yard mark and combined for 35 touchdown receptions.</p><p>Injuries limited Higgins to 12 games last season, but he still averaged a career-high 15.6 yards per reception. Chase led the Bengals with 1,216 receiving yards and seven touchdowns.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmeEeIWMo5immaKneqS0wKycZqyVmnqptcagoKerXai4qryMm5ynn5GhwG7CzqWsp6yRp8Zuu9OaqmaZnZ6xbq%2FOp6urmZOperPBzKiprA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emmahdorable-wiki-bio-age-measurements-net-worth-family-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Emmahdorable Wiki Bio, age, measurements, net worth, family, dating</span></a>
