Lohan appeared at Foxwoods with Floyd Mayweather Jr. to judge a costume contest together. The report indicates that she was suppose to show up at 10 PM, but didn’t make it until around midnight. She also skipped the Red Carpet entrance she was suppose to be a part of. &nbsp;Currently, bosses at the casino are looking to renegotiate the contract because of Lohan’s tardiness. There’s little chance they will succeed, but they are looking into it.</p><p>In other interesting news there are several photos of Lohan and Mayweather being nice and cozy at the party. There are several photos at <a href=#>The Huffington Post</a> that show Lohan and Mayweather all hugged up. Sources in the report say the two were inseparable the entire night and spent time afterwards in the VIP room. There’s nothing more to report at this time on that front, but we will be sure to keep you updated. Also, for those of you wondering about Lohan’s recovery from substance abuse,&nbsp; all reports of the night indicate that <a href=#>Lohan is clean</a> despite the fact she still loves to party.</p><p>Photo by Michael Buckner/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiZqKujmsBuvsSqrJ6rpGK9osWMm5ico12htq%2Bw0pqwZqSfna6vecyam55lnaqwqXnHqKqtoZ6ceqmty6WmsJ2Vo3qxrdGtsGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./annual-d-c-address-since-1913-crossword-clue-answer-with-4-letters.html><span>←</span><span>Annual D.C. address since 1913 Crossword Clue Answer With 4 letters</span></a>
