<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Sarah Jessica Parker: My Feet Are Deformed From Years of Wearing High Heels</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Heels-loving <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> </strong>may want to listen to what <a href=#><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker </strong></a>has to say about stilettos. In the latest issue of Net-a-Porter’s <a href=#>online magazine</a>, the Sex and the City star, who made Manolo Blahnik a household name, says she’s trading in her heels for sneaks these days — on doctor’s orders.</p><p>“For ten or so years, I literally ran in heels. I worked 18-hour days and never took them off. I wore beautiful shoes, some better made than others, and never complained,” the actress, 47, told the magazine.</p><p>After twisting her ankle on the set of I Don’t Know How She Does It, in which she wore less expensive shoes to be true to her working mom character, “I went to a foot doctor and he said, ‘Your foot does<br>things it shouldn’t be able to do. That bone there…. You’ve created that bone. It doesn’t belong there.’ The moral of the story is, the chickens are coming home to roost. It’s sad, because my feet took me all over the world, but eventually they were like, ‘You know what, we are really tired, can you just stop — and don’t put cheap shoes on us?'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The couture-addicted actress still wears heels to fancy events, but with three kids to run after (James Wilkie, 10, and twin girls Marion and Tabitha, 3), downtime is spent largely in more comfortable footwear — probably to her fashion-loving girls’ chagrin. “The emotions run so much higher,” Parker says of her daughters. “The arguing about clothes? I am stunned. We have a whole fashion system to try and override the fighting.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmqq2xnJp8r7HWrGasmaKWtW62xKyqopuRYr2ivsqeqWalqWKzprHTZpirnV2Zsqe70aacnWWWp7yuediemKurXaSzbsPEmqmippditaqzx2afnp2cqHpzfJBsb2w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-ronner-williams-serena-williams-lesser-known-half-brother-know-what-he-does.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Ronner Williams, Serena Williams Lesser Known Half Brother, Know What He Does?</span></a>
