The swipe typing is genuinely good and makes it easy to use your device with one hand, the theming is great and easily customizable, and the fact that there is native text translation is great. While those features are cool, they are just some of the tools that make Gboard what it is.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-can-i-send-gifs-with-the-google-keyboard>Where can I send GIFs with the Google keyboard?</h2><p>A lot of apps have built-in GIF finders where you can locate and send animated images with ease. Unfortunately, those tend to live in certain apps and can’t be used elsewhere. Gboard, on the other hand, basically lets you send GIFs from the keyboard just about anywhere. You can use it with Google Messages, Telegram, Slack, and so many more messaging apps.</p><p>In general, the GIF finder in Google keyboard on Android and iOS acts as a file finder. When you tap that GIF and hit send, it uploads that file to the messaging app. This is the reason it won’t work on some social media apps. For instance, you can’t comment a GIF on Instagram. Twitter, however, is free-reign.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-finding-and-sending-gifs-with-google-keyboard-on-android>Finding and sending GIFs with Google keyboard on Android</h2><p>On Android, it’s very easy to send GIFs with the Google keyboard.
