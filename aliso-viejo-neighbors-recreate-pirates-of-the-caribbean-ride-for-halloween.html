The wood is from used pallets. Computers and phone apps run all the lighting, music and sound.</p><p>After being visited by a large number of people last year, Dawn Stanley decided to also turn the Halloween display into a fundraiser for the Dana Point 5th Marine Regiment Support Group. She sets up a donation table along with hot chocolate and cookies for the nightly show from 6 to 9 p.m.</p><p>The display is open to the public through Halloween.
