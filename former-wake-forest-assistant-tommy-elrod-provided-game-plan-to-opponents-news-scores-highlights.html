"But I can assure you that we prepare each week the way that you're supposed to prepare, and I like the fact that our team knows how to do that."</span></span></p><p><span><span>On Wednesday, Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich issued a statement on the investigation, per Bruce Feldman of Fox Sports:</span></span></p><p><span><span>The ACC would also release a statement on Wednesday, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric Crawford</a> of WDRB in Louisville:</span></span></p><p>Protecting competitive integrity is fundamental to the Atlantic Coast Conference.

It's incomprehensible that a former Wake Forest student-athlete, graduate-assistant, full-time football coach, and current radio analyst for the school, would betray his alma mater. We allowed him to have full access to our players, team functions, film room, and practices. He violated our trust which negatively impacted our entire program. I am glad we have taken steps to ensure it will not happen in the future. At this point, this is a matter for [athletic director] Ron Wellman and others to act on. My staff and I are focused on Temple and preparing the team for the Military Bowl.</p><p>Despite Elrod's meddling, the Demon Deacons (6-6) have six wins for the second time in the last eight seasons. In fact, Wake's six wins in 2016 equaled the total the team combined to post during Clawson's first two years as head coach.</p><p>Looking ahead, Clawson and Co. will attempt to put the bizarre storyline in the rearview mirror as they prepare for a Dec. 27 Military Bowl clash with the Temple Owls.</p><p>If the Demon Deacons come out on top, it will represent the program's first bowl win since Grobe led Wake Forest past Navy in the 2008 EagleBank Bowl.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9wYWx%2FcnnFqKmmnaJixKK3xGadqKqVqMFurdKsoKyskaPBbsDOpqSyZZWhv7CwjKmpqK6ZmbKlecaapJ5loKGur3nTqGSoqKCku6a606w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brian-hoyer-released-by-texans-latest-comments-and-reaction-news-scores-highlights-stats-and.html><span>←</span><span>Brian Hoyer Released by Texans: Latest Comments and Reaction | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and</span></a>
