At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere. Since Taylor’s decision to leave Big Machine last fall, we have continued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties as she promotes her current record in which we do not financially participate,’ the statement started with.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/B4zhlcljUPA/</a></p><p>It went on to say: ‘The truth is, Taylor has admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars and multiple assets to our company, which is responsible for 120 hardworking employees who helped build her career. We have worked diligently to have a conversation about these matters with Taylor and her team to productively move forward. We started to see progress over the past two weeks and were optimistic as recently as yesterday that this may get resolved. However, despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families.’</p><p>They ended the response by asking Swift to have a ‘direct and honest conversation.’</p><p>The pop star’s team has already clapped back.</p><p>Although Variety cannot verify the documents obtained to be true, there are some that show a message from the Vice President, Rights Management and Business Affairs&nbsp; from Big Machine Label Group that talk about the restriction of Taylor’s contract while not agreeing to issue licenses.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Who do you think is in the wrong here?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSnrRuucCcn6KmlWK%2Fpq%2FOq5usZaKawLG7zZ2qZqyfYsGixcuoqWarp56ztXnSmrCsZaOdsrR5zKKjpaGfo8Buu8Vmm6iknJa%2FtHnIp2SdnZKpenSAkGpwa2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./suzanne-trudelle-thune-celebsgraphy.html><span>←</span><span>Suzanne Trudelle Thune Celebsgraphy</span></a>
