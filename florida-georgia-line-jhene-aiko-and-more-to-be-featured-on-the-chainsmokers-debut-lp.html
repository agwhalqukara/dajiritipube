Whether she is responsible for writing or vocals is still unknown, but if the song is anything like their certified gold single, it’s bound to be a smash.</p><p lang=qme dir=ltr><a href=#>#BLOODSTREAM</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/Cc8bgLGzmh</a></p><p>— phoebe holiday ryan (@PhoebeRyan) <a href=#>March 14, 2017</a></p><p>“There are songs about great moments and ugly moments and tempting moments,” Taggart told NME in an interview regarding the pair’s latest work. “There are people who’ll hear a song and have an idea it’s about them.”</p><p>“It’s Drew writing Drew,” he continues, discussing how he draws on his own experiences when writing these tracks. “Talking about those times when you’re not your best self and owning it. No one should feel that they have to be perfect. And we can be role models if we own our mistakes.”</p><p>April will be quite a busy month for The Chainsmokers. Not only does Memories… Do Not Open&nbsp;drop April 7, they will make their Saturday Night Live debut the following evening and on April 8, kick off a 40-date arena tour.</p><h4>Don’t forget to tweet us your thoughts, <a href=#>@CelebMix</a>.</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ks6270aKbmmWXmryzs8iaZKWhnpp6q7TEp5xmmZmgvG6yxJqrrqqVmXqktMCipayln6Cys7%2BMnZybraRiubF7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elwa-saleh-husband-wiki-parents-net-worth-age-more.html><span>←</span><span>Elwa Saleh Husband, Wiki, Parents, Net Worth, Age &amp;amp; More</span></a>
