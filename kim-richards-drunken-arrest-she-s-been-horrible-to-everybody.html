<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Kim Richards' Drunken Arrest: She's Been &amp;quot;Horrible to Everybody&amp;quot;</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Talk about bad behavior. <strong>Kim Richards</strong>’ <a href=#>shocking arrest for public intoxication</a> was preceded by erratic, moody behavior, multiple sources reveal exclusively to <strong>Us Weekly</strong>.</p><p>One source tells <strong>Us</strong> that the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star, 50, who was booked on Thursday, April 16, after a booze-fueled confrontation with police, has been treating her friends and family members horribly. “Kim has been on the outs from her family recently,” the insider tells <strong>Us</strong>. “Things are so bad that nobody can deal with her. You can’t even talk to her for two seconds — she turns horrible to everybody.”</p><p>On Thursday, Richards was taken into custody <a href=#>after causing a ruckus</a> inside the luxe Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Police told <strong>Us </strong>that the RHOBH veteran’s tirade didn’t stop there, either. At the station, she allegedly kicked an officer in the leg. She was booked on charges of public intoxication, trespassing, resisting an officer, and battery on a police officer.</p><p>Richards’ struggle with alcohol has been chronicled on the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. In 2011, the reality star checked into a rehab facility for alcohol abuse.</p><p>On a recent episode of the Bravo show, Richards’ odd behavior prompted fellow Housewife<strong> Lisa Rinna </strong>to question whether she was really sober. “I don’t drink. I don’t smoke. I don’t do drugs,” Richards sniped at Rinna. “I don’t have anything to hide.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Another insider tells <strong>Us</strong> that Richards’ family, including sister <strong>Kyle Richards</strong> and half-sister <strong>Kathy Hilton</strong>, have tried to help. “Kim has had a billion chances from the family,” the source adds. “This is so embarrassing.”</p><p>Adds the first source: “She’s just spiraling out of control.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Indeed, Richards’ relationship with Kyle has been deteriorating, as evidenced on the current season of RHOBH and during the explosive reunion. Following the airing of the reunion special on Tuesday, Kyle told<strong> Us Weekly</strong> exclusively that the siblings have yet to resolve their issues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I’m sad that it has come to this,” Kyle, 46, <a href=#>told <strong>Us</strong> at the time</a>, expressing hope that the two would work things out. “Regardless of what we have gone through, I love my sister and her children. They are incredibly important to me.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Kim’s fellow Housewives and <a href=#>Bravo host <strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> have <a href=#>tweeted their prayers and support</a> for the star. “I reached out to Kyle and the family is obviously very concerned. I don’t know exactly what happened, but I’m thinking of her,” Cohen told<strong> Ryan Seacrest </strong>on Friday, April 17. “I’m glad she wasn’t hurt, and I hope it leads to some peaceful resolution for her and her family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKipV2ntqS0wKubrGWUp8Kvt8SnZJqqoprAtXnSoZysZZKasq95x6ipq6GSobJuwM5mnK%2Bdoq6vsLDYZmlpaWVmhHU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jayden-daniels-arm-strength-at-lsu-pro-day-has-fans-buzzing-ahead-of-2024-nfl-draft-news-scores.html><span>←</span><span>Jayden Daniels' Arm Strength at LSU Pro Day Has Fans Buzzing Ahead of 2024 NFL Draft | News, Scores,</span></a>
