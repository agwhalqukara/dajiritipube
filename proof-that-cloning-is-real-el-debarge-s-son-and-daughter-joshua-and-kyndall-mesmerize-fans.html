Ferguson (@tferg3)</a></p><p>The first two clips featured El and 29-year-old Joshua, who is his father’s spitting image, singing a deconstructed version of Sade’s chart-topping single “Is It a Crime?”</p><p>From the moment Joshua opens his mouth, fans are transported back to a time when El dominated the airways with his silky voice.</p><p>Other clips show the two men joined by the 28-year-old Kyndall as they sing old DeBarge jams “A Dream” and “All This Love.”</p><p>The comment section included words like “beautiful,” “incredible,” and “magical.”<br>A few people remarked about the remarkable similarities that the family members have physically and vocally, writing, “Proof that cloning is REAL! OMG,” and “Genes are something else!!!! This blessed me.”</p><p>Before long, the short clips went viral and found themselves on the X platform, with fans just as enamored by the next generation’s voices as they were with El DeBarge’s.</p><p>One person said, “I follow Kyndall and her husband’s videos but didnt know shes el’s daughter, she got his singing voice and making it hers.”</p><p>“El DeBarge singing with his kids Josh & Kyndall has me in tears.

Over the past few years, the 62-year-old, who was once estranged from his family, has made great strides in rebuilding a relationship with his offspring.</p><p>El has 12 children, 11 of whom are his biological children and one that he has accepted as his own, by five different women.</p><p>In a 2018 interview with Jet magazine, he openly admitted that his 22-year struggle with drug addiction prevented him from being the kind of father that a sober version of himself would have aspired to be. The repercussions of his addiction led to one of his children, then just 3 years old, being removed from his and the mother’s custody and placed in the system. “I don’t know where she is,” he lamented, suspecting that she may have been adopted.</p><p>Now, clean and sober, he said he is aiming to be the best dad he can be and will never abandon his children again.</p><p>“I intend to be in their lives forever,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>. “God gave me a second chance. I am so very glad with what is going on with my career, but I want to be a success in my relationship with my children.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e5BrZmxpX5q5brDEm5irn5ViwLC6jJqlnWWUlsKotNOeqWain6i1tq2MpLCnnJGhuW6%2FyKeeoqaXZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./one-who-earns-money-on-the-links-crossword-clue-9-letters-la-times-crossword-puzzle-clue-and-answers.html><span>←</span><span>One who earns money on the links Crossword Clue 9 letters LA Times Crossword Puzzle Clue and Answers</span></a>
