They intended to live close to one another, and lived in adjoining bungalows <a href=# rel=noopener>with a shared garden</a> for a period of time.&nbsp;</p><p>But Leo and his mother ended up moving around to different neighborhoods within Los Angeles, so he lived about <a href=# rel=noopener>two miles away</a> from his father as he continued to grow. Some areas they were housed in included Echo Park and Los Feliz.</p><p>Life in east Hollywood wasn’t easy for Leo and his mother. They lived in a very poor side of town, filled with crime and substance use.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>He’s stated</a> once before, “I grew up very poor and I got to see the other side of the spectrum.”</p><p>While he has grown to be quite secretive about his private life, he has spoken about his impoverished childhood and rough surroundings several times before.</p><p>On CBS Sunday Morning, Leo opened up about his experiences:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>“I had a prostitution ring on my street corner, there were drug addicts in my alleyway, I was robbed at five years old,” Leo recounts.</p><p>“It was a pretty hardcore neighborhood and I think that gave me a lot of motivation to, sort of, I think be successful, really, and try to do something else.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A Dedicated Mother</h2><p>Irmelin saw the grand potential in Leo, and was determined to provide him with opportunities that could take him away from the dangerous district he was growing up within.&nbsp;</p><p>He went to Seeds Elementary School and also John Marshall High School, but later revealed his dislike for public school. Rather, <a href=# rel=noopener>he wanted his mother</a> to bring him to auditions to help better their financial status.</p><p>She happily obliged, working hard in several jobs while driving him around to give him the opportunity to audition as much as possible.</p><p>In his winning Best Actor speech at the BAFTA’s in 2016, Leo declared his gratitude for the determination of his mother when he was a child:</p><p>“I didn’t grow up in a life of privilege. I grew up in a very rough neighborhood in east Los Angeles. This woman drove me three hours a day to a different school to show me a different opportunity. It’s her birthday today. Mom, happy birthday. I love you very much.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Feeding His Talents</h2><p>After considering a potential career path as a marine biologist when he was young, Leo leaned more towards acting, since he enjoyed imitating those around him for fun.&nbsp;</p><p>“Very early on I was always impersonating different characters, imitating people who came by. I loved doing that and getting the amazing experience of seeing people’s reactions,” <a href=# rel=noopener>he told Parade</a> in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>1979 was his first role. He was credited as “child” in one episode of Romper Room, but was reportedly taken off the set for being <a href=# rel=noopener>disorderly and acting out</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>From there things started looking up, and eventually Leo’s role as Jack in Titanic soared his fame into superstardom.</p><p>In addition to acting, Leo also now uses his massive platform to promote his fierce passion for environmentalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Conserving at least 30% of the planet would not only prevent mass extinctions and curb the climate crisis through proven nature-based solutions, but with the right policies in place, could be beneficial to the global economy. <a href=#>https://t.co/D32b8lS4U0</a></p>— Leonardo DiCaprio (@LeoDiCaprio) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 9, 2020</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfnqqVYrGqsIylnKimkaexsHnDopqaqKKevG6z0aiuZq2gZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elizabeth-hurley-57-appears-attractive-in-a-swimsuit.html><span>←</span><span>Elizabeth Hurley, 57, Appears Attractive In A Swimsuit</span></a>
