Actually, TLC fans thnk that he‚Äôs very sweet and adorable. But this week, Amy‚Äôs parenting skills were put to the test. Her son decided that perhaps the cat needed a haircut. So, he took off after it with scissors.</p><h3>Amy King Parents Her Son Daxton Without Violence</h3><p>Remember the big fuss when Josh Duggar was found guilty of CSAM-related offenses? Well, Jana Duggar ended up in the spotlight after <a href=#>a child she was looking after got</a> away and was found wandering around unattended. Anyway, it was her cousin who defended her. After all, she has experience with a mischievous little boy of her own. Daxton looks cute, but all kids can be a bit headstrong sometimes and they need correction. But in the case of Dillon‚Äôs wife, there‚Äôs no physical violence when it comes to discipline.</p><p>Amy King and her son do a lot of fun things together. Actually, she‚Äôs one relative who still considers Jill Dillard a friend. Often, they take their boys to the thrift stores and splash out on books and clothing for the children. It also keeps them amused when they buy new toys. <a href=#>Daxton loved</a> some of the things his mom chose for him. Nowadays, he‚Äôs at the age where he can start to learn to use scissors to cut things. But his mom told him off when he took off after the family cat.</p><h3>Amy King Lectures Daxton After Scissors & A Cat Incident</h3><p>Cats are suspicious creatures and when they are around young kids, they have good cause to exercise caution. It would be interesting to know how many kids in the world tried to give their kitty a haircut. On the weekend, the former TLC support character revealed herself talking to Daxton about the scissors and the cat. She saw him take them and make off towards the cta. So, she intervened. Instead of raging and shouting, she spoke with him in a serious tone about why he shouldn‚Äôt use scissors on living beings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Amy-King.jpg><p>Amy King said in her caption:</p><p>‚ÄúHe now has paper to cut at the table supervised! I could tell he wanted to use the scissors and then ran off‚Äî umm excuse sir where are you going with those!? Yelling doesn‚Äôt do anything but harm them.. but by talking effectively and communicating with him he understood!üòÖWe can use the scissors of course! Just not on the cat! #blesshim‚Äù</p><h3>Gentle Parenting</h3><p>In her caption, Amy King also said, ‚ÄúGentle Parenting is why there‚Äôs wine in the fridge! Winston, I saved you!üêà‚Äç‚¨õ‚úÇÔ∏è.‚Äù</p><p>Probably, because she doesn‚Äôt agree with the way the Duggar family raised their kids, the TLC alum prefers to avoid violence. It‚Äôs been an open secret for years that the Counting On kids were disciplined under the tenets of the Institute In Basic Life Principles</p><p>One follower commented, ‚ÄúGood job Mom! Cheers to positive parenting and Cheers to wine in the fridge! This is how we parented our 2 kids. One listened the first time and one we repeated ourselves until we were blue in the face at times. Both hugely successful humans and both married and doing life just fine.‚Äù</p><p>What are your thoughts?&nbsp; let us know in the comments below.</p><p>Be sure to catch up on everything happening with the TLC alums right now.
