According to court records obtained by People on March 28, she cited irreconcilable differences as the grounds for her divorce. Alvina is also requesting spousal support and that Anthony pay her lawyer’s expenses. Despite the former’s request that the property acquired during the marriage be considered community property to be shared between the parties, the filing classified the following as separate property:</p><p>“All gifts and inheritance, all assets, incomes, accumulations, and debts obtained by [Alvina] previous to marriage and after separation, the precise form and amount of which are unknown.”</p><p>The Blast was the first to publish the news, and Anthony’s agent has yet to respond.</p><h2>Everything there is to know about Anthony Anderson’s wife.</h2><p>Alvina Anderson is most known as Anthony Anderson’s wife, and her present occupation is unclear. Her ethnicity is African-American, and her nationality is American.

Despite the fact that the former dropped out of his junior year owing to financial difficulties, he intends to graduate with his kid this year. The couple married in 1999 and have been married for almost 22 years. Alvina, on the other hand, had already filed for divorce in 2015, citing irreconcilable differences and stating that she would allow her fair husband visitation with their children.</p><p>Alvina also alleged that they had not lived together since April 2014 and that her divorce petition was subsequently denied in 2017. They have two children, Nathan and Kyra.&nbsp;Nathan is following in his father’s footsteps by appearing on Joseph’s “Rev Run” Simmons’ program All About the Washingtons. Meanwhile, Kyra earned a bachelor’s degree in sociology and ethnic studies from the University of San Diego.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Alvina-Anderson-3.jpg alt="Alvina Anderson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>All About Anthony Anderson</h2><p>Anthony Anderson is best known for his role in the television comedy series Black-ish.
