Like, I love chips, and I love snacks and stuff, I just don’t eat a lot of it.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Becoming a mom has also altered what Alba finds most important. While she admitted entering her 30s — Alba turned 34 on Tuesday — was “sad,” she now feels “better than ever.”</p><p>“I think you just have a different mentality on what really matters, the older you get,” she told <strong>Us</strong>.</p><p>One thing that’s very important in her household, though, is vegetables! “I make them just try it, even if they don’t like it,” <strong>Cash Warren</strong>’s wife said of getting her daughters to eat their greens at the event hosted by Tiny Prints, an online stationary boutique that has an exclusive line of birth announcements benefiting Baby2Baby. “Honor is like ‘I don’t like mushrooms,’ and I’m like, ‘Well, just have one bite’…I just figure if I keep, once a week or once every other week, have her at least try it again and try it again and try it again, maybe we’ll have a break through moment,” she added, laughing. “But, it’s not an option for them to eat vegetables. It’s like you have to eat vegetables in your meal somehow…or else you’re gonna be in deep trouble!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKGeq6OesKJ5wKWZmmWimsOmrcusZKGdomKxqrHTZp%2Bor12otaZ5xp6rrGWYmr9ut8idqmasn2KyosCMr5ygn5mawG5%2Bj2psbGhk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-her-silence-on-her-decision-to-quit-grey-s-anatomy-ellen-pompeo.html><span>←</span><span>Breaking Her Silence On Her Decision To Quit Greys Anatomy, Ellen Pompeo</span></a>
