The 55-year-old Oscar nominee, and star of Eternals, kicked off 2022 by posing in her swimsuit while vacationing in the tropics. "May this new year bring you the awareness of your own strength. Happy, healthy 2022," she captioned the sultry snap. How does the 55-year-old manage to look half her age?

Instead she maintains a healthy lifestyle. "I don't like to diet and I'm not good at it," she says on her Cooler Cleanse website. "Everybody has a weakness and mine is food," she added to More.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/GettyImages-1353704053.jpg><p><span>Salma tries to eat as plant-based as possible. "The only thing I do is that I don't eat animals every day. I eat all kinds of meat, but I consume it sparsely," she dished to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>New York Times</span></a><span> about her diet. "I would never eat two meats in a day. Sometimes I go several days without eating meat, but then I'll go back."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Salma encourages juicing and even started her own juice company, </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Cooler Cleanse</span></a><span>. "When I feel stressed, I turn to food for comfort," she explains on her website. "After doing a juice cleanse, I'm motivated to eat healthier and not emotionally." To her, cleansing is a form of meditation. "It makes me stop, focus and think about what I'm putting into my body. I'm making a commitment to my health and hitting the reset button."</span></p><p><span></span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Salma eats eccentric, colorful meals like her "breakfast special." The trademark dish includes chopped up salad of papaya, blueberries, mango, strawberries, pomegranate seeds, celery, red pepper, and cucumber, atop almond and coconut butter and yogurt. "It doesn't sound like it tastes great but it's delicious," she wrote on </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Instagram</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/GettyImages-1352461528.jpg><p><span>"Some people have the discipline to exercise in the morning, and I didn't develop that," Salma told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>People</span></a><span>. Instead, conventional exercises, she stretches. "I work with a woman in London who taught me how to hold my body in a way where the muscles are activated all day long. So even when you brush your teeth, you're working the muscles," she continued. "It's restorative yoga. She taught me how to tone [my muscles] without clenching them. You relax them and focus on the parts that need to be used, but never with tension. If you're aware of your body, you'd be surprised by the effect it can have."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/GettyImages-1351811848.jpg><p><span>Salma is a big proponent of self-care."Massage oxygenates, activates the circulation, and keeps the muscles healthy and firm. I cannot tell you, even just for the lymphatic [system], what the massage does for the face," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Vogue</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/GettyImages-1349812063.jpg><p><span>Salma maintains that meditation is one of her secrets to longevity. "It makes you experience your body with a lightness that's really delicious and satisfying," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>InStyle </span></a><span>for its July 2021 issue. "With the breathing and the going inside, you explore your body in a different way, and you learn not to go crazy with the expectations."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/GettyImages-1347405339.jpg><p><span>Salma is used to gaining and losing weight, and she's totally okay with it. She admitted to InStyle that a lot of the swimsuit pics she posted in spring 2021 were actually taken over the Christmas holiday, and took a bunch since she knew she would be gaining weight for her role in House of Gucci. "I don't have any shame in telling you this because I'm excited that I even got to that point. For a week I looked like that, you know?" she said. And, like anyone, she maintains the weight takes a lot longer to lose than it did to gain. "I've lost very little. You go, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa.' You gain it so fast, but it takes so long to lose it."&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkrJmcoq5utMCynKRlmaN6o63ToaCnn12owqrAjLCgrKCVqHq6u9Rmn5qooK56c3yRa2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lara-worthington-shows-off-her-cleavage-and-super-slim-figure-in-a-strapless-swimsuit.html><span>←</span><span>Lara Worthington shows off her cleavage and super slim figure in a strapless swimsuit</span></a>
