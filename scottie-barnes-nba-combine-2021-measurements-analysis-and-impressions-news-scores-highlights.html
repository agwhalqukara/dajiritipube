His wingspan is 7'2¾", and he has a 9' standing reach.</p><p>NBA draft analyst <a href=# rel=noopener>Chad Ford</a> wrote about how Barnes' wingspan could vault him into the top five overall: "Scottie Barnes’ nearly 7-foot-3 wingspan is partly why so many teams are now projecting him as a top-five pick. You don’t find many point guards with his size and length."</p><p>Barnes' wingspan was the sixth-longest at the Combine and first among players not listed as power forwards or centers. <a href=# rel=noopener>John Hollinger</a> of the Athletic raved about him Tuesday, saying the following in part.</p><p><i>"I’m really surprised Barnes isn’t getting more buzz. He could easily end up as the best player in this draft and has a case for being the top pick.</i></p><p><i>"</i><i>Again, the search for big wings comes first at the NBA level, and everything comes later—and the playoffs are showing why. Barnes has weaknesses, and we’ll get to them in a minute, but there is early Spurs-era Kawhi Leonard upside here as well.</i><i>"</i></p><p><a href=#>Jonathan Wasserman</a>&nbsp;of Bleacher Report ranked him No. 7 on his latest 2021 draft prospect big board and <a href=#>No. 6</a> in his last mock draft.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloYGuBd3%2BMrJqorKSesm6uwKulnqtdo6%2BiecKopJuhnpp6c3yRamSmnZGowrOxzJ6lratdlruiuNisoKxlkaOxbrXMqameq6OevK%2B%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./net-worth-wedding-husband-todd-tucker-daughter-riley-weight-loss.html><span>←</span><span>Net Worth, Wedding, Husband Todd Tucker, Daughter Riley, Weight Loss</span></a>
