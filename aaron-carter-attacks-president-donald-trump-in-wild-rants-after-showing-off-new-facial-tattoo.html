I’m in the North Pole now! you can’t find me now!”</p><p>He added: “So I’m about to get a rental car and drive a few hours to go see my new home. I’m moving fast. 😈 My Brother in law Mike lives here and my niece Alyssa so I have family here, and Nova Scotia is one of my FAVORITE PLACES IN THE WORLd! Plus, it makes for shorter flights for Europe tour.”</p><p>The artist went on to reveal: “I just purchased this 7 million dollar 💵 Island In Kaulbach Island 🌴 in Halifax. Good luck finding me. These waters get cold. I put 1.5 million down to get away from the drama and make my music. I love you all. #WeAreTheWorld”</p><p>He also attacked Trump: “Now I bought a home here, and I’m leaving all that bulls— behind in America. I honestly cannot stand my f—ing president and the way my fans treat me there F— that s—.”</p><p>He piled on: “Man, I was just f*cking with everybody. Y’all take sh*t wayyyyy too seriously. I hope I’ve made my point. I already purchased a home in Nova Scotia, and I honestly do not support @realDonaldTrump; it’s time to leave the USA & leave the bullsh*t there and stay puffing on the best BC.”</p><p>Carter has been going through some difficult times behind the scenes recently, but that has not stopped him from making some new moves in his private life.</p><p>Indeed, Carter seems to be moving quite fast in this regard, as he recently showed off a brand new tattoo — on his face, of all places.</p><p>He also took off his shirt while claiming that he was the biggest thing in music right now and demanded to be “fact-checked.”</p><p>This all comes out not long after Carter came out with the shocking accusations that his late sister had molested him when they were children.</p><p>Carter then went on to say that he has been considering killing his pregnant sister-in-law and their unborn child, which prompted his brother and sister to take out restraining orders against him.</p><p>Many of Carter’s fans have been scratching their heads over the situation, and many have urged him to seek help for his issues.</p><p>Carter made some additional tweets in which he claimed that he would be going to court for the restraining order his sister has against him.</p><p>However, he does not have any plans to do the same for his brother’s restraining order, adding that he did not care if he wanted him around himself or not.</p><p>He finished with the dramatic statement that he had no plans to ever speak to his brother, Nick, or anyone in the family in the future, so the situation was fine on his end.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>These tweets got even more of his fans worked up.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRlr%2BwuoycmKuslad6osDTmpqkq12lv6a%2FyJ2cp6xdmbyvrcudZK2qpaK9brXNZq6ipJRiv6K606xkmp6kmr9uv8eorqKml2K8p7KMp5ywZZaWsKqty2armqykpLxuf5FwbW5oXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./swedish-quartet-that-sang-fernando.html><span>←</span><span>Swedish quartet that sang Fernando</span></a>
