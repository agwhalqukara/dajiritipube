First he lost his mother and then Kyle and Summer Newman (Alison Lanier) divorced-and now a nanny he’s attached to has gone.</p><p>There is plenty of family support but Kyle will still need a nanny-fortunately, someone who loves children and is good with them who might want a job like that soon-Claire!</p><p>Claire and Summer are cousins since Nick Newman (Joshua Morrow) is her dad, and thanks to Victor Newman’s (Eric Braeden) plan to publicize Claire being Baby Eve the family now knows!</p><h3>The Young And The Restless Spoilers: Claire Grace Has Never Dated</h3><p>Claire obviously has never dated since Jordan raised her for revenge with no time for boys-and she’s pretty and blonde, like Summer.</p><p>Kyle burned his bridges when he cheated on Summer which may give Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle) pause should Kyle hire Claire and then want to date her. Victor and the Newmans would likely give Kyle a good talking to that he’d better not hurt Claire like he hurt Summer!</p><p><a href=#>Summer may even warn Claire once they get acquainted,</a> but sometimes the heart wants what and who it wants, and a coupling up may happen anyway.</p><p>Hopefully Kyle has learned his lesson about waffling and if for no other reason, treat Claire right for little Harrison’s sake!</p><p>Be sure to catch up on everything happening with Y & R right now.
