However, the Mariners' direction is clear after a few disappointing seasons with their most recent core, so he is not as good of a fit now as the team imagined when he signed an extension.</p><p>Overall, Segura's bat is a fantastic asset for any club. His .302 batting average with the M's over the past two years is made more impressive when considering he played roughly half of his games in Safeco Field, which is one of <a href=#>MLB</a>'s most notorious <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pitcher's parks</a>.</p><p>He's one of MLB's better hitting shortstops and has proved to be durable with 142 or more games played in five of the past six years.</p><p>He joins a Phillies team looking to take the next step after posting an 80-82 record in 2018—a 14-game improvement from the following year.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaXFoZ2WFdXnJnpinZaOatLa%2BwGamn56ZmLaiuMuyZK2qkZmypXnTqGSpoJmhuaqx0madq6edYrqivsinnKurXZu8s3nJqWScqpGss7C%2Bw2akqKqV</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elizabeth-hurley-in-bathing-suit-goes-on-pretend-vacation-celebwell.html><span>←</span><span>Elizabeth Hurley in Bathing Suit Goes on Pretend Vacation Celebwell</span></a>
