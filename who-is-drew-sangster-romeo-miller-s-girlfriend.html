As a result, information on her parents’ names and identities has not been provided to the media. There is also no information on whether she has any siblings.</p><h3><strong>Drew Sangster’s Ethnicity and Nationality</strong></h3><p>Without any information on her background and parents’ ethnicity, information on Drew Sangster’s ethnicity is not readily available. However, judging from her looks, we can conclude that she has mixed ethnicity. As for her nationality, Drew was born in America. Therefore, she has American nationality.</p><h2><strong>Drew Sangster’s Relationship with Romeo Miller Made Her Famous</strong></h2><p>Drew Sangster stepped into the limelight after she was identified as the girlfriend of popular American actor and rapper Romeo Miller. The love birds have been together for a while now. Their relationship became Instagram official on November 27, 2020, after Romeo shared a video of them celebrating Thanksgiving together.</p><p>However, according to the post, the love birds have been together longer than that. Romeo revealed in an interview he had with the Mix that they were together all through the weekend and that after years of being single, Drew was an answer to his prayers.</p><p>He said Drew had sent him books for every month of the pandemic. She also sent him handwritten letters stating 138 reasons why she was happy being with him. However, as juicy as the details of the couple’s relationship may seem, they prefer to keep it away from the media as much as they can.</p><p>According to Romeo, after years of being in the industry, he has learned how important it is to keep one’s private life private, especially when it comes to dating.</p><h3><strong>Do Drew Sangster and Romeo Miller Have Any Children Together?</strong></h3><p>For now, the celebrity couple have one child together. The birth of their baby was announced on Valentine’s day, February 14, 2022, when he shared an <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;</a>video capturing his joy on his Instagram page.</p><p>Under the post, Miller said that although having a baby had been on his wish list for a long time now, he and his girlfriend had to keep news of their expectancy under wraps to ensure a smooth pregnancy.</p><p>However, he was too happy to contain the joy and just had to share the good news with his fans. The baby girl, whom Romeo nicknamed Baby R, is growing happily and lively with both of her parents, who dedicate most of their time to ensuring that she has a great childhood.</p><h2><strong>What Does Romeo Miller’s Girlfriend Do for a Living?</strong></h2><p>From the modicum information available about Drew Sangster’s career, we learned that she owns a store called The Drewy Co. She reportedly started this business with her partner Romeo in 2021. Our checks show that their business deals in apparells, exotic fragrances, care packages, and other family-oriented care products.</p><p>Their products are particularly kid-friendly, and they seem to cater more to children’s needs though they still stock a variety of other family-themed merchandise.</p><p>Drew is also leveraging her husband’s popularity to create awareness for their business and ultimately increase sales. Romeo is a famous name in the entertainment world and comes from a very popular family. He occasionally signs some of the products they sell as a way of branding and making them unique. Of course, these specially branded items often attract more sales volume.</p><p>On the other hand, as a way of giving back to their community, Drew and Romeo have, on many occasions, donated items to charity. These items include diapers, wipes, and other essential items for children. By doing this, the couple not only improves the lives of many indigent children and their families, but they also have a sense of fulfilment in running their business.</p><h2><strong>Drew Sangster’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Although she has never revealed her exact net worth, we can say that she makes some decent income from her online store, enough to afford her a comfortable lifestyle. But going by estimates, Drew, as a small business owner, could be making as much as $51,000 in sales annually as a small fashion store owner. However, this is nothing compared to her husband’s net worth.</p><p>Drew Sangster’s husband, Romeo Miller, is a millionaire with a net worth estimated to be about $5 million. The New Orleans, Louisiana, native has been able to earn the bulk of this sum from his music career as a rapper and actor. No doubt, Drew also enjoys this wealth with her husband.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmsKCfYra0ecOrnLBlo5a7qL%2FTnqlmqp%2BisrB5zKKjpZ2iqHqotdGlnauhlaOxcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./quinta-brunson-height-how-tall-is-the-american-writer-actress-and-producer.html><span>←</span><span>Quinta Brunson Height - How Tall is the American Writer, Actress and Producer?</span></a>
