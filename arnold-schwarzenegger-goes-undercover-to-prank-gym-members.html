The video is an effort to raise donations for his After-School All-Stars program in Los Angeles, which he founded in 2002 to provide productive and healthy extracurricular opportunities for students.</p><p>[<a href=#>Hit this link to see the video</a>]</p><p>When it comes to Arnie disguising himself, we think he’s found his new calling – “I have noticed lately people love to put me in disguises,” Arnold told commenters. “You obviously saw the Bjorn Borg look. But I also made this video with Reddit in mind, so I might as well put it out now.” I think we can expect to see him in plenty more going forward.</p><p>Image via Ken Ishii/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiYq6afobFuv8Khrpqqqpq7prPGnqlmn5%2BawG7BzZ2cq5ufq7Kzec%2BrmKejXZzGrnnMnqSbnaKofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./richard-engel.html><span>←</span><span>Richard Engel</span></a>
