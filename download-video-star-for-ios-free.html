Produce your music videos, edit, and add effects from one place.<p>Video Star, is a music video maker. You air guitar in the shower and you dance along to the radio during your commute. When music is that much a part of your life, don’t you need an app to reflect all your musical know-how? Be the star of your own video.</p><p>With Video Star, you don’t need to have an amazing singing voice. Your vocals aren’t included. This app is all about the visual side of things. Use your iPad or your iPhone and capture your creative side while you bust a move or lip sync to the music.</p><p>Grab your phone and choose your preferred video format (landscape, square, or portrait). Next, select a song from the music library built into the app, or upload from your iTunes account, and start recording. It's that easy.</p><p>Are you seeing double? Yes, you can create clones of yourself. Set up a slow-motion movie or zip along in fast forward for a different take. Green screen effects and stop motion videos are a click away. Your music will follow along right with your creative editing process. You can pause whenever you want so you can style a new scene using filters, text, or whatever else you dream up.</p><h3>Up your creative game</h3><p>Speaking of the editing process, you can change the way your videos look from beginning to end. Comb through the Power Packs for new edits and features to enhance your work of art at any point you choose. You don’t need to leave the app.</p><p>Power Packs make Video Star fun. It’s the extra shiny bits that make your video stand out and get noticed.</p><p>For the best of everything, you’ll need to spend some money. The All Access Pass is the best way to get new features and effects. Power Packs are individual buys while the All Access Pass is for the whole shebang.</p><p>The All Access Pass lets you unleash all the options in Video Star and VideoFX Live. All the packs are unlocked, including any packs that release during the time you have the service. You can still make separate pack buys if you so desire.</p><p>Video Star All-Access Passes are auto-renewing. If you want to extend your service for more than a month at a time, you can opt for three months or to a yearly pass. If you decide a year is too long, you are able to downgrade your plan. Any changes need to go into effect at least twenty-four hours before the end of the current period.</p><p>It is worth noting that if buy new packs, those are still yours -- whether you continue with the All Access Pass.</p><p>Are you testing out the app with a free trial? If you choose to spring for the premium version, wait until your trial runs out. Otherwise, you’ll lose your trial access.</p><h3>Make it your own</h3><p>Head to the gear icon to change the settings. From here, you can switch out the background color or lock your device in sandwich mode so you can get to work. You can change your video’s resolution from 360p to 720p, or 1080p with a click of the button. A lower resolution can help reduce the strain (and subsequent lag) of filming on an older phone.</p><p>If you want to know the latest song updates or take a look at the most popular songs on the service, you can opt to receive a daily new video notification. Tap on the icon for free updates.</p><p>As if that weren’t enough, for a backstage pass to all that’s new and exciting in the world of Video Star, you need to click the heart icon. Fall in love with the new content updates, contests to win free packs, and popular song updates.</p><p>You can discover a video creator you haven’t viewed before with the channel shoutout. Find amazing, new videos created by other fans of the Video Star app. You’ll never want for video creation inspo.</p><h3>Where can you run this program?</h3><p>Video Star is only for Apple devices. You can use Video Star on iPhones and iPads. It requires iOS 10.0 or later.&nbsp;</p><h3>Is there a better alternative?</h3><p>Spark Video Editor handles video a bit different. Instead of recording a film and editing, Spark lets you put related clips together. You’ll edit these different clips before merging them to create your video. It’s a great tool for vacations or special events but isn’t about filming on the fly. Spark has a different audience compared to Tik Tok.</p><p>If you want to tone things down a little and aren’t into the stars and hearts icons of Tik Tok, Adobe Premiere Rush for Video is for the serious video editor. Not only is it part of the Adobe Creative Cloud, so its free with a paid plan, but it’s packed with features other apps often lack (like long-form video and cross-device compatibility). It does offer fast and slow motion capabilities but everything about this app screams “professional.”</p><p>Adobe lacks the fun feel of Spark and Tik Tok but nothing beats Adobe’s color correction or lighting adjustment tools.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmicn6y7rbvAnapnnJmctrWty62pnqaUqHuku8xoraKclaR6tMDAq2aip6M%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-owen-wilson-ever-meet-his-daughter-lyla-aranya-wilson.html><span>←</span><span>Did Owen Wilson ever meet his daughter, Lyla Aranya Wilson?</span></a>
